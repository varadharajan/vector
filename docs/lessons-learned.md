##7. Lessons Learned

* Group dynamics proved very important to finishing the project. Although mentioned from the beginning by Professor Edwards, having a leader for the project, Howie, was very helpful for setting up the initial vision and feature set, as well as keeping the development process consistent with the goals at hand. Having said that, active communication between members in weekly meetings was also extremely valuable in making informed decisions about implementing the language.

* For a large group working on a large project, focusing on feature requirements on a given week and to disperse the work instead of having one person to work on a given component was a great decision and one I would suggest future groups to make. In retrospect, this decisino was what gave each member some familiarity to each part, making it easier to make changes iteratively. Along the same lines, pairing for feature developments was also very helpful not only for team members to enforce one another to commit time, but also to have more than one person responsible for a part.
