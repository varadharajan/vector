##7. Lessons Learned

###Harry Lee
* Group dynamics proved very important to finishing the project. Although mentioned from the beginning by Professor Edwards, having a leader for the project, Howie, was very helpful for setting up the initial vision and feature set, as well as keeping the development process consistent with the goals at hand. 

* For a large group working on a large project, focusing on feature requirements on a given week and to disperse the work instead of having one person to work on a given component was a great decision and one I would suggest future groups to make. In retrospect, this decisino was what gave each member some familiarity to each part, making it easier to make changes iteratively.
